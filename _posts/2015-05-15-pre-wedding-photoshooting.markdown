We had the pleasure of welcoming [Apostolis Platanias](https://www.facebook.com/plataniasphotography){:target="_blank"} to Bristol for our pre-wedding photo shooting and show him so many beautiful spots of our city. Our journey started with [Clifton Suspension Bridge](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.454743,-2.625441,3a,75y,296.27h,94.04t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s5MbKEpu31bsTu_Shg8rV6g!2e0){:target="_blank"}, an amazing monument of engineering excellence, continued with [Clifton Downs](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.458994,-2.626813,3a,75y,279.05h,101.56t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sBEH0AKBehpDapjqpaDPI6A!2e0){:target="_blank"} and the beautiful green area next to the parks. The following day started with the vivid area of [Stokes Croft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_Croft){:target="_blank"} where we took pictures in front of very expressive graffiti. Our walk continued into [Harbourside](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.447189,-2.602191,3a,75y,77.63h,80.9t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sLFHrmum9KcYZ3v-0RrNZqg!2e0?hl=en){:target="_blank"} next to the old railway and antique wagons. Although we were tempted to take pictures inside [SS Great Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Britain){:target="_blank"}, we decided to take advantage of the very sunny day and walk to [Brandon Hill](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.454026,-2.606837,3a,75y,116.88h,71.38t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s6Uvt2KkbK8IAAAQXBYi4rg!2e0!3e11?hl=en){:target="_blank"} where the generous park with the [Cabot Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabot_Tower,_Bristol){:target="_blank"} and the panoramic view of the city rewarded us with nice pictures on the grass. Our final destination was the [Lover's Walk](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.467253,-2.599164,3a,75y,36.38h,97.82t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sMWJB2XcjJSfhaCjEwmtHfg!2e0!6m1!1e1){:target="_blank"} just beside [Cotham Gardens](http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/leisure-and-culture/cotham-gardens){:target="_blank"}.
